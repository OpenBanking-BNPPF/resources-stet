The answer embeds: \n  <ul>\n    <li>A location link of the saved request that will be further used to retrieve the request and its status information. </li>\n    <li>The URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform an authentication. </li>\n  </ul>\n  \n<h3>Payment confirmation</h3>\nCase of the PSU successfully confirms his payment, the response is returned to the PISP using the call back URL.\n\nCase of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the request expires and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is equal to 60 minutes.\n\n<h3>Payment instruments supported</h3>\nFollowing payment instruments are supported at this stage:\n  <ul>\n    <li>single SEPA Credit Transfer</li>\n    <li>single International Payment</li>\n    <li>single Standing Order (Belgian to Belgian) </li>\n    <li>single Instant Payment </li>\n  </ul>\n\nThe following table indicates how to use the different fields, depending on the payment instrument:\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Structure</td>\n<td>SEPA payment</td>\n<td> Standing orders</td>\n<td>International payment</td>\n<td>Instant payment</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>numberOfTransaction (payment level)</td>\n<td>Only \"1\"</td>\n<td>Only \"1\"</td>\n<td>Only \"1\"</td>\n<td>Only \"1\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pymentTypeInformation/ InstructionPriority (payment level)</td>\n<td>Must be empty or one of the following values:\n<ul>\n  <li>\"HIGH\" for high-priority, Only supported for Corporate customers </li>\n  <li>\"NORM\" for normal </li>\n  <li>Default value \"NORM\" </li>\n  </ul>\n</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Must be empty or one of the following values:\n<ul>\n  <li>\"HIGH\" for high-priority, Only supported for Corporate customers </li>\n  <li>\"NORM\" for normal </li>\n  <li>Default value \"NORM\" </li>\n  </ul>\n</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td> \n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PaymentTypeInformation/ ServiceLevel (payment level)</td>\n<td>\"SEPA\"</td>\n<td>\"SEPA\"</td>\n<td>Must be empty</td>\n<td>\"SEPA\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PaymentTypeInformation/ LocalInstrument (payment level)</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>\"INST\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PaymentTypeInformation/ CategoryPurpose (payment level)</td>\n<td>Only applicable for Corporate customers.\n<ul>\n<li>\"DIVI\": Dividend</li>\n<li>\"INTC\": Intra Company Payment</li>\n<li>\"INTE\": Interest Payment</li>\n<li>\"PENS\": Pension Payment</li>\n<li>\"SALA\": Salary Payment</li>\n<li>\"SSBE\": Social Security Benefit</li>\n<li>\"SUPP\": Supplier Payment</li>\n<li>\"TAXS\": Tax Payment</li>\n<li>\"TREA\": Treasury Payment</li>\n<li>Please note that following values are not supported: \"CASH\",  \"DVPM\"</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Only applicable for Corporate customers.\n<ul>\n<li>\"DIVI\": Dividend</li>\n<li>\"INTC\": Intra Company Payment</li>\n<li>\"INTE\": Interest Payment</li>\n<li>\"PENS\": Pension Payment</li>\n<li>\"SALA\": Salary Payment</li>\n<li>\"SSBE\": Social Security Benefit</li>\n<li>\"SUPP\": Supplier Payment</li>\n<li>\"TAXS\": Tax Payment</li>\n<li>\"TREA\": Treasury Payment</li>\n<li>Please note that following values are not supported: \"CASH\",  \"DVPM\"</li>\n</ul></td> <td>Only applicable for Corporate customers.\n<ul>\n<li>\"DIVI\": Dividend</li>\n<li>\"INTC\": Intra Company Payment</li>\n<li>\"INTE\": Interest Payment</li>\n<li>\"PENS\": Pension Payment</li>\n<li>\"SALA\": Salary Payment</li>\n<li>\"SSBE\": Social Security Benefit</li>\n<li>\"SUPP\": Supplier Payment</li>\n<li>\"TAXS\": Tax Payment</li>\n<li>\"TREA\": Treasury Payment</li>\n<li>Please note that following values are not supported: \"CASH\",  \"DVPM\"</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debtor (payment level)</td>\n<td>\nOptional. \n<ul>\n<li>If not specified, then PSU can choose the debtor account in the redirection flow.</li>\n<li>If specified, then IBAN must be provided.

Thus, the parameter 'businessLineName' must always be set to 'CPB'.\n  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n  <ul>\n\n  <li>The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the\n  PISP role. </li>\n\n  <li>The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 \"Client Credential\" access token\n  by the ASPSP. </li>\n\n  <li>The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and\n  authentication. </li>\n\n  <li>The TPP has presented its \"OAUTH2 Client Credential\" access token.\n\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>Authentication approach</h3>\n\n\n  The only authentication approach supported is the REDIRECT authentication.\n\n\n  <h3>Payment initiation</h3>\n\n  The ASPSP saves the request and answers to the PISP. The answer embeds: \n\n  <ul>\n\n  <li>A location link of the saved request that will be further used to\n  retrieve the request and its status information. </li>\n\n  <li>The URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to\n  perform an authentication. </li>\n\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>Payment confirmation</h3>\n\n  Case of the PSU successfully confirms his payment, the response is returned to the PISP using the call back URL.\n\n\n  Case of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the request expires and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is equal to 60 minutes.\n",
